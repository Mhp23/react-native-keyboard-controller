With this latest release, I introduce the `useKeyboardController` hook and `setEnabled` method, which allows for a gradual integration of the library into your project, enabling you to disable the module on specific screens as needed. This flexible feature ensures that your app\'s keyboard behavior remains seamless and user-friendly.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What\'s New in Version 1.8.0: The `setEnabled` Hook\\n\\nThe star feature of `react-native-keyboard-controller` version `1.8.0` is the introduction of the `setEnabled` method. This method provides developers with granular control over when and where the library\'s keyboard management should be active.\\n\\n### How to Use `setEnabled`\\n\\nUsing the `setEnabled` method is incredibly straightforward. Here\'s a quick example of how to integrate it into your React Native project:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { useKeyboardController } from \'react-native-keyboard-controller\';\\n\\nconst { enabled, setEnabled } = useKeyboardController();\\n\\n// if you want to know whether is module active at the moment\\nconsole.log(enabled);\\n\\n// disable keyboard controller on a specific screen\\nsetEnabled(false);\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we\'re importing the `useKeyboardController` hook from the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library. This hook returns `setEnabled` method (which you can use to disable keyboard management for a specific screen) and `enabled` variable (indicating whether the module is active now or not).\\n\\nWhen you disable the module using `setEnabled(false)`, the screen will fallback to the default `Android` behavior, automatically resizing based on `AndroidManifest` preferences (`android:windowSoftInputMode`). This level of control allows you to tailor the keyboard experience to your app\'s unique needs on a per-screen basis.\\n\\n### Use Cases for `setEnabled`\\n\\nThe `setEnabled` method is incredibly versatile and can be employed in various scenarios:\\n\\n- **Forms**: Disable keyboard management on screens with simple forms that don\'t require custom keyboard management.\\n\\n- **Chat Interfaces**: Keep keyboard management enabled for chat screens, ensuring smooth and consistent user experiences during messaging interactions.\\n\\n- **Gradual Integration**: Tailor keyboard functionality on specific pages where you require precise control over how the keyboard behaves, while leaving other screens unaffected by these adjustments.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n`react-native-keyboard-controller` continues to evolve, making it an essential tool for React Native developers who want to provide exceptional user experiences in their mobile apps.\\n\\nWith the introduction of the `setEnabled` method in version `1.8.0`, you now have even more control over keyboard behavior, ensuring that your app feels polished and responsive \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nTo get started with the latest version, check out the [official documentation](../) and explore the new possibilities that the `setEnabled` method offers.\\n\\nUpgrade your React Native project today and take your keyboard management to the next level with `react-native-keyboard-controller` version `1.8.0`!\\n\\nStay tuned for future updates and releases as I continue to enhance the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library.

It\'s especially important when you want your app to look and feel polished on both `iOS` and `Android` devices. While the built-in `KeyboardAvoidingView` component in React Native works well for `iOS`, it doesn\'t provide the same level of smoothness and consistency on `Android`.\\n\\nI have been hard at work, and in this upcoming release, I\'m thrilled to unveil the enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView`. With this component, you can achieve a seamless keyboard animation experience across both major platforms \u2013 `iOS` and `Android`.\\n\\n## Features of `KeyboardAvoidingView`\\n\\n### Platform-agnostic Animation\\n\\nWith the new `KeyboardAvoidingView`, you can say goodbye to platform-specific workarounds. This component is designed to work harmoniously on both `iOS` and `Android`, ensuring a consistent user experience throughout your app.\\n\\n### Smoother Animations\\n\\nThe enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView` offers smoother and more natural animations when the keyboard appears or disappears. This means your UI elements will gracefully adjust to accommodate the keyboard, preventing awkward overlaps and ensuring your users can interact with your app seamlessly.\\n\\n### Backward Compatible and Seamless Integration\\n\\nI understand the importance of maintaining compatibility with existing codebases and providing a smooth transition for React Native developers. With enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView`, I\'ve put compatibility at the forefront of design principles.\\n\\nThe `KeyboardAvoidingView` is crafted to seamlessly integrate with your existing React Native projects. It\'s a **drop-in** replacement for the default React Native `KeyboardAvoidingView` component. This means that you can start using an enhanced version without the need for extensive code modifications or rewrites.\\n\\nWhether you\'re working on a brand-new project or updating an existing app, making the switch to re-implemented `KeyboardAvoidingView` is as simple as updating your import statements. Your existing codebase remains intact, and the benefits of smoother animations and cross-platform compatibility come without the hassle \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n### Customizable\\n\\nI believe that the best tools are those that adapt to your unique project requirements. That\'s why I\'m excited to introduce a dedicated avenue for customization. If you find that the default behavior of `KeyboardAvoidingView` doesn\'t precisely align with your app\'s needs, I encourage you to explore the possibilities of customization \ud83e\udd13\\n\\n#### Share Your Ideas and Report Bugs \ud83d\udca1\\n\\nYour feedback is invaluable to me. If you have ideas for new features, improvements, or you encounter any issues while using `KeyboardAvoidingView`, I invite you to get involved. Feel free to submit your suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports through my [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller) repository.\\n\\nThe community is built on collaboration, and together, I believe we can make this library even better. By actively participating and sharing your insights, you contribute to the growth and enhancement of `react-native-keyboard-controller` and `KeyboardAvoidingView` in a particular.\\n\\n## What\'s Coming Next\\n\\nWhile I\'m excited to introduce the `KeyboardAvoidingView` in this release, my commitment to making your React Native development experience smoother doesn\'t stop here. I have big plans to expand the library with more pre-built components designed to simplify complex tasks related to keyboard handling.\\n\\nIn the pipeline, you can look forward to components like `KeyboardAwareScrollView` for effortlessly managing scroll views, `StickyFooter` for keeping crucial UI elements in view, and much more. My goal is to provide you with a comprehensive toolkit for creating exceptional user interfaces in React Native.\\n\\nStay tuned for future updates and releases as I continue to enhance the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library.
