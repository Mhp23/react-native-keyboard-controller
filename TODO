# ToDo

- (x) restore TextInput switching functionality
- (x) detect and scroll TextInput grows
- (x) remove old code from fabric/unify examples
- scrollResponderScrollNativeHandleToKeyboard
- think about renaming FocusedInputLayoutChangedObserver -> FocusedInputObserver
- (?) focus -> change focus -> blur ==> movement of content is very small
- send `null` when there is no input in focus
- "grow" is not scrolling on the extended height after few clicks <- update scrollPosition after maybeScroll
- when dispatching focusInput -> compare by height? because keyboardWillShow triggers when user types first letter
- focus on 3, focus on 5 -> scroll looks strange
- jest -> add new mocks
- improve events precision (int -> float, pageY, width точно float или double)
- contentContainerStyle -> paddingBottom should depend on keyboard size
