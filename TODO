# ToDo

- (x) restore TextInput switching functionality
- (x) detect and scroll TextInput grows
- (x) remove old code from fabric/unify examples
- (x) "grow" is not scrolling on the extended height after few clicks <- update scrollPosition after maybeScroll
- (?) focus -> change focus -> blur ==> movement of content is very small
- (?) when dispatching focusInput -> compare by height? because keyboardWillShow triggers when user types first letter <- we anyway plan to update layout when user types letters?
- (x) contentContainerStyle -> paddingBottom should depend on keyboard size <- added additional view
- (x) focus on 3, focus on 5 -> scroll looks strange <- persist scroll on tag changes as well
- scrollResponderScrollNativeHandleToKeyboard
- think about renaming FocusedInputLayoutChangedObserver -> FocusedInputObserver
- 
- send `null` when there is no input in focus
- jest -> add new mocks + new unit tests
- improve events precision (int -> float, pageY, width точно float или double)
- const {update} = useReanimatedFocusedInput(); <- requires REA3
- crash on every file changes AwareScrollView/hot reload
- console.log("focus was changed -> scrolling") (even when keyboard appears)
- focus on field -> type any symbol -> close keyboard => no back transition animation
