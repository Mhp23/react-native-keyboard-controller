Thus this library allows you to track each keyboard frame movement, and create corresponding reactions (move elements accordingly).\\n\\nThe first release of this library brings missing `keyboardWillShow`/`keyboardWillHide` events on `Android` making `events` module fully cross-platform as well as adding a way to use `Animated.Value` for managing keyboard frames.\\n\\nIn further releases the API will be enhanced:\\n- support will be added for interactive keyboard dismissing (on Android)\\n- the library will be rewritten to new `Fabric` architecture\\n- maybe some components, such as `KeyboardAvoidingView`/`KeyboardAwareScrollView` will be available here with better performance and animations.\\n\\nStay tuned! \ud83d\ude0a"}]}')}}]);
